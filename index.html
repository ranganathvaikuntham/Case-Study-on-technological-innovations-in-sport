           <p class="lead mb-5">
          We begin with the well known chatbots and their role in the sports industry.
      </p>
      <p>
      	<strong>What is a chatbot?</strong> <br>
      	Chatbot is simply a software capable of talking to an individual ou consumer by its capabilities to generate automatic conversations. <br>
      	Talking more specifically means generating human-like , comprehensible and complex-enough conversations. <br> <br>

      	Chatbots may be hosted on a messaging tool like 'Whatsapp' or 'Messenger'. They are generally hosted on Messenger application for allowing easier access to a larger public. <br> <br>

      	They are employed by many companies in various sectors like Banking, Finance etc.


      </p>

          <p >
          	<strong> Exemples du chatbot dans le domaine du sport </br></strong>
          	<br>
          	Let us look at where and how chatbots are being implemented in our domain of interest - sports.
          </p>

         </p>
          <p><img src="img/fred.png"  width = "40% height="40%"  align="left">
            IBM have used their Watson technology and created a chatbot called 'ASK FRED' for the Wimbledoon tournaments. <br>
            This is an interesting chatbot because it works in colloboration with 'Smart Stadium' technologies and enhances the user experience. <br>
            With its capabilities of a chatbot and connections to internet and the stadium sensors, it has multifaceted capabilities.
            For one, we can use and talk to the chatbot regarding the smart stadium data like restroom availabilities in real time for example. With its connections to the internet we get real time stats of the matches and even the possibility to buy tickets.

          </p>
          <p>
          	Another interesting example of chatbots
           <div class="content-section-heading text-center">
            <img src="img/barcelona.jpg" align="center">
          </div>
           </p>

          The two diverse well-known examples of chatbots shown above demonstrate the ability of chatbots to be versatile and valuable for improving the user experience and capturing audience through various means. With the advancements in technology, we may encounter more chatbots in other areas of our life.

 			<strong> Architectures of chatbot </br></strong>



              <pre> Chatbot with AI                       				Chatbot without IA </pre> </br>
           

    <img src="img/chatbotavecAI.png" alt="Logo"  />
       Two types of architechtures of chatbots possible.

     </br><pre>                           &nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="img/chatbtuexp.png" >  </pre>


		From the images above we see that we can either use a simple decision tree for our chatbot or we can use NLP(Natural Language Processing) for creating our Chatbot architechture. <br> <br>

      <strong> Domaines et types du chatbot </strong> </br>
           
            <img src="img/DomainesChatbots.png" align="left">
          	Chatbots may be categorized in a different manner as well. 

          	There are two types of chatbots- Retrieval based and Generative Based.
          	Retrieval based works on the simple principle of retrieving the information from a database.
          	The database could be an excel, SQL, websites with information , RSS flux etc.

          	On the other hand, Generative chatbots understand the user questions and responses a little more and are capable of creating personalised responses catering to the demand at hand.
           	These type of chatbots require the use of Machine learning and NLP, the architechtures of which we discussed in the section before.

          <p>Wearable technology is a hot market in recent times. With the purchase of Fitbit by Google for a whopping 5 Billion, more attention is being drawn to this domain than ever before. Research advancements in IOT - Sensor Networks, Analytics are revolutionilising the domain of Wearable technologies and their connectivity with the internet.  <br>
          	<br>

          The market for Wearable technology is vast and ever growing, but for our research let us stick to their usage and applications in the sports industry. </p>

          <p><strong> First the basics </strong> <br>
          	What is IOT and Wearable Tech?  <br>

          	IOT or internet of things represents networks of variety of connected objects. These objects are capable of connecting and sharing information with the internet. 
          	Wearable technology are simply appliacances or devices equipped with IOT technologies and are for being worn by humans.
          	

          	<p><strong> In the domain of sports </strong> <br>
          	As of today, the three main areas where IOT-wearable technology is being used is for Player development, Player safety and for fan engagement. These three factors have a huge impact on the performance and financial gain for a sports club, hence clubs are investing millions of dollars on the latest technologies.	

          	</p>

          </p>


           <p >
           	<strong>How does the process work? </strong>
          	<img src="img/iotuses2.png" align="right">
          	<br>The figure to the right encapsulates the process for analytics to be implemented in sports. <br>
          	First the players are equipped with various sensors which track their movements and measure vital signs from them like speed, heartrate, pressure etc.
          	These data combined with the live match video feed are used to feed an algorithm which analyses them and gives suggestions/information in real time.
          </p>
          <br>
          <br> <br>

          <strong>Some examples of real-world applications</strong>

           <p >
           	<img src="img/casquesIOT.jpg" align="left">
           	The problem of injury is one serious issue for players of the NFL. Being an intense physical sport there are often crashes and falls which could impact many parts of the body, most important being the head. Concussions in players are not unheard of.  <br>

			
           	To tackle this challenge NFL has decided to harness the power of IOT. They are building sensor equipped helmets which track the impacts in real time and alert the coaching and medical staff in advance by predicting the susceptible injuries in players.

           	<br>
          	<br>
          </p>

           <p>

           	Here let us look at an example real-time player tracking dashboard for coaches and training teams. <br>
          	<img src="img/tennis iot performance tracking.jpg" width = "40% height="40%" align="right">
          	<br>Crucial statistics like shot power, pressure, speed, Hydration in the player can be tracked in real time with sensors embedded on wearable technology.

          	<br>Assesments are then made of players in various situations enabling a correction or improvement suggestion from the coaches.  

          	Critical points of failure in individual athletes and their weaknesses and strengths may be analysed as well. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <br><br><br>
          Let us now shift our attention to smart-stadiums
           <p >
           	Recently grand stadiums are embracing IOT trends and becoming more 'intelligent'.
          	<img src="img/iotex2.png" align="right">
          	<br> <strong>What do we mean by intelligence here?</strong> <br>
          	Equipped with sensors and connections to the internet, the stadiums are offering more pleasant experiences for the fans.

          	Information like Restroom Availability, Parking Availability and Stadium directions are provided in real time through sensors. With access to internet even replays and in-seat concession ordering features are pampering fans of the sport.
          </p>

          <strong> Technical details -How does this all work?</strong>
          <br>
          For wearable devices equipped with IOT technology there are three main steps:
