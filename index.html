           <p >
          We begin with the well known chatbots and their role in the sports industry.
      </p>
      <p>
      	<strong>What is a chatbot?</strong> <br>
      	Chatbot is simply a software capable of talking to an individual ou consumer by its capabilities to generate automatic conversations. <br>
      	Talking more specifically means generating human-like , comprehensible and complex-enough conversations. <br> <br>

      	Chatbots may be hosted on a messaging tool like 'Whatsapp' or 'Messenger'. They are generally hosted on Messenger application for allowing easier access to a larger public. <br> <br>

      	They are employed by many companies in various sectors like Banking, Finance etc.


      </p>

          <p >
          	<strong> Examples of chatbots in the Sports domain </br></strong>
          	<br>
          	Let us look at where and how chatbots are being implemented in our domain of interest - sports.
          </p>

         </p>
          <p><img src="img/fred.png"  width = "40% height="40%"  align="left">
            IBM have used their Watson technology and created a chatbot called 'ASK FRED' for the Wimbledoon tournaments. <br>
            This is an interesting chatbot because it works in colloboration with 'Smart Stadium' technologies and enhances the user experience. <br>
            With its capabilities of a chatbot and connections to internet and the stadium sensors, it has multifaceted capabilities.
            For one, we can use and talk to the chatbot regarding the smart stadium data like restroom availabilities in real time for example. With its connections to the internet we get real time stats of the matches and even the possibility to buy tickets.

          </p>
          <p><br><br><br>
          	Another interesting example of Chatbots in the sports industry. <br>
           
            <br><img src="img/barcelona.jpg" align="right">The football club of 'FC Barcelona' decided to launch their own chatbot which comes in-built with their application to increase fan satisfaction and engagement. <br>
            The user gets to reply to questions posed by the application and the chatbot will eventually learn the fan tastes and suggest personalised content feed. <br>
            There is a substantial amount of Recommender systems logic being implemented as well.
             
          
            <br><br>
           </p>

          The two diverse well-known examples of chatbots shown above demonstrate the ability of chatbots to be versatile and valuable for improving the user experience and capturing audience through various means. With the advancements in technology, we may encounter more chatbots in other areas of our life.
          <p class="lead mb-5">

 			<strong> Architectures of chatbot </br></strong>



              <pre> Chatbot with AI                       				Chatbot without IA </pre> </br>
           

    <img src="img/chatbotavecAI.png" alt="Logo"  />
       Two types of architechtures of chatbots possible.  
   <!--  <img src="img/chatbtuexp.png" > -->
    <img src="img/sansiachatbot.png" alt="Logo" />
     </br><pre>                           &nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="img/chatbtuexp.png" >  </pre>


		From the images above we see that we can either use a simple decision tree for our chatbot or we can use NLP(Natural Language Processing) for creating our Chatbot architechture. <br> <br>
           </div>	
        
		</p> 


          <p>
          	
      <strong> Domain and types of chatbots </strong> </br>
           
            <img src="img/DomainesChatbots.png" align="left">
          	Chatbots may be categorized in a different manner as well. 

          	There are two types of chatbots- Retrieval based and Generative Based.
          	Retrieval based works on the simple principle of retrieving the information from a database.
          	The database could be an excel, SQL, websites with information , RSS flux etc.

          	On the other hand, Generative chatbots understand the user questions and responses a little more and are capable of creating personalised responses catering to the demand at hand.
           	These type of chatbots require the use of Machine learning and NLP, the architechtures of which we discussed in the section before.
           	<br>
           	<br>
           	Now the difficulty of implementing these chatbots may change depending on its type and domain of application. <br><br>
           	The easiest type of chatbot to implement would be a retrieval-based in a closed domain. It would simply work with certain pre-defined rules and queries, sort of like our decision tree described above.<br><br>

           	Staying within a closed domain, a generative based chatbot would be a little harder to create as it would have to understand human queries albeit in a restricted domain of interest. <br><br>

           	Moving on to an Open Domain, where there are no restrictions on topics of questioning, we acknowledge that building a Retrieval-Based chatbot in the Open Domain would be impossible.
           	This is because we can build a decision tree like query structure for an infinitely large domain. <br><br>

           	And finally of course, the hardest chatbot to build would be a General AI which can understand and reply to questions on any given topic. This could be a part of the General Intelligence which many fear to be a part of the AI-Singularity.

          <h2 class="mb-5 large-font" align="center"> Computer Vision </h2>
          <strong>What is Computer Vision?</strong>
          <p> Computer vision is an interdisciplinary scientific field that is concerned with
 teaching computers a high level of understanding from digital images or videos. <br><br>
In the field of sport, researchers are training deep learning neural networks to achieve accuracy that surpasses humans in the ability to quickly capture and understand a variety of situations from photos and videos.
For the next step in the future, they are working on building processes integrated into an automated framework. </p>
          <strong>Application to the sports industry</strong>
          <p> Let us look at some examples of Computer Vision applied to the sport industry </p>
          <p >
          	<img src="img/roboref.jpg" align="left">
 			The image to the left shows the prototype image of the Robot referrees being planned to be introduced by the NBA by 2021. This particular one called 'Danny' would be equipped with computer vision technology and feed from various cameras including its own, and hence it could comprehend the game from the Point of view of many angles and be capable to take refereeing decisions much more accurately and unbiased than a human. <br><br>

 			Although, lots of ethical questions are being posed about referees losing their jobs and possible security issues with the robot referree which is initiating debates on its implementation. <br><br><br>
          </p>

          <p><br><br> <br><br><br><br>
          	
          	<img src="img/hawkeye.jpg" align="right">
          	Many of you must be familiar with the image on the right, it is a hawkeye prediction system.<br><br> During matches of tennis when the player challenges the call of the referree, this system is called upon. Using Computer vision and ball-tracking technology, Hawkeye predicts whether the ball had fallen in or out.
<br><br><br>
          </p>

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/119193860" width="640" height="388" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen align="left"></iframe> <br><br><br>
						The video on the left is taken from the site of CSAIL. This is one of the labs at the forefront of sports-technology research. Through the video we see the capability of the Computer Vision technology to rate a human diver from the video footage. <br> <br>


			We can assume no bias unless intentionally maliciously fed into the system, hence the system would rate the divers unbiasedly only based on their performance. Another very interesting point is that this technology, through motion tracking and computer vision training is capable of providing the diver feedback on how to improve based on their recent performance. A certain amount of NLP capabilities are also attached to this system. <br><br><br><br><br><br> <br><br><br>
          </p>

          <strong>Technical remarks and accompanying case study -NASCAR crash prevention</strong> 

          <br><br>NASCAR is one of the most popular and well known races in not just the USA but the world. Throughout history this fast paced action sport has been considered quite dangerous and risky due to the number of accidents that could possibly occur when multiple cars are circuiting laps at record speeds. Even historical facts verify this assumption.

          <br><br> Now NASCAR is capitalizing on Computer Vision technologies to drastically reduce the amount of fatal crashes that happen every year.
          <p> <br>
          	<img src="img/cv-nascar1.jpg" align="left">
          	The idea is quite simple. <br> <br>Cameras are set up througout the race track. Back in the days of yore, pictures were taken of cars at high speed and the pictures were verified by experts in recognising cars from these 'blurry' high-speed images. Then through the pictures the defects in the cars were identified and appropriately the pit-stop teams were informed to prevent car-failures and hence eventual crashes. <br> <br>

          	This is where Computer Vision application comes  into play. Although, cars were identified by human trained experts, this process was always not quite efficient or accurate. <br><br>
          	With the advancements in technology, computers are being asked to identify cars in real time.  
          </p>

          <p>
          	<strong> How is this being done so? (Technical Details) </strong> <br>
          	We are employing Convolutional Neural Networks to perform this task of image classification.<br><br>
          	<img src="img/cv-nascar2.png" align="right">
          	Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) are made up of many layers as shown in the figure to the right.
          	<br>The input is an image in the form of a matrix and the output is a one hot encoded classification. <br>
          	Just like any Machine Learning model we need a training and test set. The model is fed with traning models and their corresponding labels and through iterations the CNN learns the important features for distinguishing the images. <br>
          	Then we test on the test data to see the capacity of the model to work on unseen new real-world data.<br> <br>
 			To dissect and understand our model a little more, let us take the output of one of the feature maps after a few iterations of training (sufficiently trained by now with little error rate).<br> <br>
 			What we would see is shown in the picture above. The image of the on the right car would be transformed into the one on the left where only the numbers are visible. This means that the feature maps are giving more weightage to the numbers on the vehicles as features.
 			This is in sync with our logic because indeed the numbers being unique for each vehicle are one key method to identifying the vehicles.

          <p>Wearable technology is a hot market in recent times. With the purchase of Fitbit by Google for a whopping 5 Billion, more attention is being drawn to this domain than ever before. Research advancements in IOT - Sensor Networks, Analytics are revolutionilising the domain of Wearable technologies and their connectivity with the internet.  <br>
          	<br>

          The market for Wearable technology is vast and ever growing, but for our research let us stick to their usage and applications in the sports industry. </p>

          <p><strong> First the basics </strong> <br>
          	What is IOT and Wearable Tech?  <br>

          	IOT or internet of things represents networks of variety of connected objects. These objects are capable of connecting and sharing information with the internet. 
          	Wearable technology are simply appliacances or devices equipped with IOT technologies and are for being worn by humans.
          	

          	<p><strong> In the domain of sports </strong> <br>
          	As of today, the three main areas where IOT-wearable technology is being used is for Player development, Player safety and for fan engagement. These three factors have a huge impact on the performance and financial gain for a sports club, hence clubs are investing millions of dollars on the latest technologies.

           	<strong>How does the process work? </strong>
          	<img src="img/iotuses2.png" align="right">
          	<br>The figure to the right encapsulates the process for analytics to be implemented in sports. <br>
          	First the players are equipped with various sensors which track their movements and measure vital signs from them like speed, heartrate, pressure etc.
          	These data combined with the live match video feed are used to feed an algorithm which analyses them and gives suggestions/information in real time.
          </p>
          <br>
          <br> <br>

          <strong>Some examples of real-world applications</strong>

           <p >
           	<img src="img/casquesIOT.jpg" align="left">
           	The problem of injury is one serious issue for players of the NFL. Being an intense physical sport there are often crashes and falls which could impact many parts of the body, most important being the head. Concussions in players are not unheard of.  <br>

			
           	To tackle this challenge NFL has decided to harness the power of IOT. They are building sensor equipped helmets which track the impacts in real time and alert the coaching and medical staff in advance by predicting the susceptible injuries in players.

           	<br>
          	<br>
          </p>

           <p>

           	Here let us look at an example real-time player tracking dashboard for coaches and training teams. <br>
          	<img src="img/tennis iot performance tracking.jpg" width = "40% height="40%" align="right">
          	<br>Crucial statistics like shot power, pressure, speed, Hydration in the player can be tracked in real time with sensors embedded on wearable technology.

          	<br>Assesments are then made of players in various situations enabling a correction or improvement suggestion from the coaches.  

          	Critical points of failure in individual athletes and their weaknesses and strengths may be analysed as well. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <br><br><br>
          Let us now shift our attention to smart-stadiums
           <p >
           	Recently grand stadiums are embracing IOT trends and becoming more 'intelligent'. <br>

          	<br> <strong>What do we mean by intelligence here?</strong> <br>
          	Equipped with sensors and connections to the internet, the stadiums are offering more pleasant experiences for the fans.

          	Information like Restroom Availability, Parking Availability and Stadium directions are provided in real time through sensors. With access to internet even replays and in-seat concession ordering features are pampering fans of the sport. <br><br><br>
          </p>

          <strong> Technical details -How does this all work?</strong>
          <br>
          For wearable devices equipped with IOT technology there are three main steps:
          <br><br> 

          <p><img src="img/BAN-IOT.jpg" align="left">
          	 First, the player is equipped with a Body Area Network (BAN). This is a network that consists of many sensors like heartbeat, temperature, pressure etc. Critical regions of the body which need to be monitored are targeted according to the sport. <br><br>

          	 The BAN consists also of a gateway which collects all the flux of information from the sensors and connects to the internet. Think of it like a path to the internet.

                     <p><img src="img/Cloud-IOT.png" align="right"><br><br><br><br>Once we are connected to the internet, now these data are stored and processed on the cloud. Various cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud , Azure etc are often used and designated in the process workflow.
          	
          </p>


           <p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><img src="img/Dashboards-IOT.jpg" align="left"> Finally, the analysed results on the cloud are often sent to dashboards for visualisation in a human comprehensible manner. <br><br>
           	Often these dashboards used by the coaching staff are hosted on the cloud itself for providing dynamic and interactive analysis and feed back for individual players.
